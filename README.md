Hangman Game

A very simple javascript game that displays a randomly selected word as a series of underscores that correspond with a word randomly selected from an array of words. 

There is an input field where the player can input letters and if the letter is correct, it will display a corresponding message and replace the corresponding underscore with the correct letter. If the letter is incorrect, it will add it to the letters guest list and subtract 1 from the number of guesses. 

The player wins if all of the underscores are replaced with the correct letters, and the wins counter increments by 1. 

The player loses by failing to guess all of the correct letters in the randomly selected word before using all of the guesses. In this case the losses counter is incremented by 1.
